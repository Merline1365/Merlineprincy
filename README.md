This code calculates and visualizes the trend and seasonality of a time series.
Trend is computed using a moving average with a window size q provided by the user.
Seasonality is extracted by subtracting the trend from the data and averaging the differences over periodic intervals.
The results (original data, trend, and seasonality) are plotted for easy visualization.
In short, it decomposes the time series into its trend and seasonal patterns.
